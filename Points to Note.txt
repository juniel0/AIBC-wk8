#from Jina
if you already have an existing project and you have already created an empty repo, you can follow the following steps:
git init
#J: change branch from master to main
git branch -m master main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git remote -v
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Initial commit with gitignore" (the initial commit message can be whatever you want)
git push -u origin main
